## Human rights at sea
In the maritime industry basic human rights can often be abused. Some crew members have to live at sea for long periods of time with basically no sleep, food or water. It can be a form of modern slavery since the crew members also risk getting no pay from their employee.

## glass ship
This projects aims to give crew members an easier way of reporting the abuse that they might face in their day-to-day lives. With this application the crew can give distress signals and also give a rating of the ship based on how well they feel that their rights were upheld. The data that is collected through this app can be used to pressure companies to change their ways and also pressure other companies not to do buisness with them. Hopefully this can eliminate human rights abuse at sea.
